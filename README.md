# watsapp-parser
Creating stats from watsapp messages

To run: 
- Change name of file to read (TO-DO: pass file name as parameter) 
- python whatsapp_parser.py


TO-DO LIST: 
- [ ] Make the script be able to pick out whatsapp general messages like renaming group name, or status of encryption
- [ ] In counting occurences of words, have a 0 as a default value. For now it crashes if someone never said 'lol'..
- [ ] Figure out the emoji issue.
- [ ] clean up the cleaning portion or even use regex.
- [ ] make a word cloud.. :-D
